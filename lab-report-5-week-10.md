# Using VIMDIFF

## By Adhithya Ananthan

In this post I will explain how I used the vimdiff command to find differences in the outputs of two implementations of markdownparse. vimdiff is very helpful for being able to notice differencees between files without having to manually look through them.

In lab 9 we created two results.txt files, one containing the outputs for the TA's implementation of markdown parse and anothere containing our group's implementation of markdown parse. We can use vimdiff to compare the two files.

Above we can see what vimdiff looks like when comparing the two files. From this we can see that the test case for 32.md and 342.md are different.
